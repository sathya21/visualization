# visualization
Summary
This visualization is about baseball players statistics. It explores different handedness, height, weight and their relationship with HR and average.First visualization explores the relationship between height, Average and HR for different handedness. Second visualization explores the relationship between height and HR average for different handedness. Third visualization provides distribution of data points for various heights.

Design Choices

1) I decided to explore the relationship between handedness, average and their HR. Since it has 3 variables, based on the grammar of graphics, i used Scatter plot for the visualization.

2)  Second visualization i choose was the comparison between handedness and HR for different heights. Choose Column chart as there are very few categories for the same.

3) I also wanted to show the distribution of data points for the height and handedness as it will help to ignore categories that have fewer data points.

Feedback

Feedback 1 ( Myles)

What I noticed (combined with relationships that I noticed):

I noticed that there is a relatively smooth negative relationship between batting average and height for Left and Both handedness (which was unexpected), and no apparent relationship for Right handers

I noticed that there is a positive relationship between home runs and height for Left and Right handedness (which was expected), and little apparent relationship for Both handedness. This relationship has what appears to be an outlier at 67 inches, which is very odd.

Finally, I noticed that there is a symmetric distribution of heights, for all handedness, amongst baseball players - which is amazingly consistent between groups.


What questions I have about the data:

Too many to list. There was no description of the dataset, so I don't know who it covers (it is obviously not for little league, because there are no 11 year olds that are 6'7'' but beyond that, I don't know anything about the data. One or two lines about the dataset would help) .

I know enough about baseball to guess what "average", "B", "L", and "R" etc mean, but there is no information on the visualization telling people who don't know these concepts what they mean.

Apart from the lack of descriptions, overall it is a very clear presentation of the information that it is intended to convey.

Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?:

No, as I say, I understand enough about baseball to guess what each part of the visualization refers to.
Overall, a very nice job!!
